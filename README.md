### How do I get set up? ###

* To get this repository on your computer, you will need [Mercurial](https://mercurial.selenic.com/) installed. Once complete, you should be able to issue the following command wherever you want the repository located: `clone https://bitbucket.org/stephen-paul-chappell/qtpipe`
* To run `qtpipe.py`, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. Please note that there are two versions of Python in popular use, Python 2 and Python 3. QTpipe is currently designed for use with Python 3.
* QTpipe has no dependencies beyond Python's standard library that comes bundled with its installation. Once Python 3 is installed, this utility should work without need for changes.
* There are several settings at the top of `qtpipe.py` that may be changed if needed. In particular `DEFAULT_HOST` and `DEFAULT_PORT` may be set to other values if appropriate.
* To test the program to see if it is working properly, open two terminals on the same computer and pipe data into one and out of the other. You may also do the same across a network by specifying the appropriate command line arguments.
* You may deploy the program as-is across a network as long as Python 3 is installed on the target machines. For development, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is supported by making use of the `.idea` diretory in the repository.
